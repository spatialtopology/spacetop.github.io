{:toc}

# Starting a new project?
* Please read [wiki](https://canlabweb.colorado.edu/wiki/doku.php/master_table_of_contents/internal/projects/project_template/project_template) before you get started 
* [dev comments] We'll probably have to update this wiki once we move to Dartmouth

# Aims
* Read the [grant proposal](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BnZ-v0hHyp6xuFJt8PYUWy7l3YJaIxG7) (private) 
* Read the [IRB protocol]() (private access)



# Github
[helpful resources](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/)
1. create your own repo
2. spatialtopology Github will fork your repo
3., 4, 5 follow this https://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435
3. on the RTMNF computer, use git bash. git clone your fork
4. add remote from original repo to your forked repo
5. update your fork
` git pull upstream master` This updates your local repo
`git push origin master` in order to update your remote spatialtopology repo


how to solve some errors?
use https instead of git://github.com .... etc
git remote set-url origin https://SPATIALTOPOLOGY.git
git remote set-url upstream https://YOUROWNREPO.git

check via `git remote -v`

always pull before you start anything

step 2 working on the RTNP computer
1. create a new branch where you'll work on
This branch will not have a lot of edits 
- mostly changes in the directory name, tailored to the RTNF laptop
